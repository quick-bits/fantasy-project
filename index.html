                <span>What is Fantasy?</span> <br> <br> Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction set in a fictional universe, often inspired by real world myth and folklore. Its roots are in oral traditions, which then became fantasy literature and drama.
                From the twentieth century it has expanded further into various media, including film, television, graphic novels, manga and video games. <br> Fantasy is distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the absence of scientific
                or macabre themes respectively, though these genres overlap. In popular culture, the fantasy genre predominantly features settings of a medieval nature. In its broadest sense, however, fantasy consists of works by many writers, artists,
                filmmakers, and musicians from ancient myths and legends to many recent and popular works. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. <br> Magic and magical creatures are common in
                many of these worlds. An identifying trait of fantasy is the author's use of narrative elements that do not have to rely on history or nature to be coherent.[1] This differs from realistic fiction in that realistic fiction has to attend
                to the history and natural laws of reality, where fantasy does not. In writing fantasy the author creates characters, situations, and settings that are not possible in reality.
